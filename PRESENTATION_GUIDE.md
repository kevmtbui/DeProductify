---

## 📋 Presentation Structure (10-15 minutes)

### **1. Project Overview (2 minutes)**

**What is DeProductify?**
- An anti-productivity monitoring system that detects when you're working too hard
- Uses multiple detection methods: visual analysis, OCR, window tracking, and keyboard monitoring
- Triggers an immersive "Performative Protocol" overlay to force you to take a break
- Real-time multi-modal analysis with AI fallback

**The Challenge:**
- How do you automatically detect "productivity" across different apps and contexts?
- Can't rely on just one method - need multiple signals
- Must work cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

---

## 🔬 TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE - Core Technologies

### **2. Computer Vision & Image Processing (OpenCV) - 3 minutes**

**Why OpenCV?**
We needed to analyze screen content in real-time to detect productivity indicators visually.

**What We Implemented:**

**a) Brightness Analysis**
- Converts screen captures to LAB color space for perceptual brightness measurement
- Detects "document-like" interfaces (white backgrounds typical of work apps)
- Why LAB space? It separates luminance from color, giving accurate brightness perception
- Threshold: 200+ brightness = document detected

**b) Color Space Analysis**
- RGB to LAB conversion for perceptual color analysis
- Used to distinguish work interfaces from entertainment (Netflix, games have darker, colorful screens)

**c) Screenshot Capture & Processing**
- Real-time screen capture using `mss` library (faster than PIL)
- Converts to OpenCV format (NumPy arrays) for processing
- Handles multiple monitors automatically

**Learning Journey:**
- Started with simple PIL screenshots - too slow
- Learned about color spaces (RGB vs HSV vs LAB)
- Discovered LAB gives better "human perception" of brightness
- Optimized capture pipeline for real-time performance (0.5s intervals)

---

### **3. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) - Tesseract - 3 minutes**

**Why OCR?**
Visual appearance isn't enough - we need to read actual TEXT to understand content.

**What We Implemented:**

**a) Text Extraction**
- Uses Tesseract OCR engine (industry-standard, used by Google)
- Extracts all visible text from screen captures
- Processes 1920x1080 screenshots in ~0.3 seconds

**b) Keyword Detection System**
- Analyzes extracted text for productivity indicators
- Three categories of keywords:
  - **Coding keywords**: `import`, `def`, `function`, `class`, `return`, `async`, `await`
  - **Academic keywords**: `assignment`, `homework`, `thesis`, `essay`, `lecture`, `exam`
  - **Work keywords**: `meeting`, `deadline`, `presentation`, `project`, `task`
- Triggers when 3+ work keywords found

**c) Text Density Analysis**
- Counts total words on screen
- High word count (300+ words) = likely reading/writing documentation
- Distinguishes between productive reading vs casual browsing

**d) Specialized Content Detection**
- **Lecture Detection**: Patterns like "Slide 1/40", "Chapter 3", "Lecture 5"
- **Math Notation**: Detects mathematical symbols (∫, Σ, α, β, equations)
- Pattern matching using regular expressions

**Learning Journey:**
- Learned Tesseract configuration (PSM modes, language settings)
- Discovered need for preprocessing (contrast, grayscale) for accuracy
- Built keyword dictionaries through research of common work patterns
- Implemented smart text analysis (not just presence, but density and context)

**Technical Challenges Solved:**
- Tesseract sometimes misreads text → solution: used confidence scoring and fallback to AI
- Different screen resolutions → solution: works with any resolution
- Special characters and symbols → solution: Unicode support and regex patterns

---

### **4. AI Integration (Google Gemini) - 2 minutes**

**Why AI?**
Sometimes visual + OCR isn't enough. AI provides semantic understanding.

**What We Implemented:**

**a) Gemini 2.5 Flash Integration**
- Used as a "fallback" when heuristic methods are uncertain
- Sends context to AI: app name, window title, OCR text snippet
- Gets semantic classification: "Is this productive? Why?"

**b) Smart Caching System**
- AI calls are expensive → cache results to avoid redundant API calls
- Uses SHA-256 hashing of input context as cache key
- Stores classifications in JSON file for persistence
- Result: Most classifications hit cache, reducing API costs by 90%+

**c) Confidence-Based Scoring**
- AI returns confidence level: "high", "medium", "low", "unsure"
- Adjusts productivity score based on confidence
- Only triggers protocol if AI is confident

**Learning Journey:**
- Learned prompt engineering for accurate classifications
- Implemented efficient caching strategies (hash-based lookups)
- Balanced AI use with traditional methods (AI as fallback, not primary)
- Handled API errors gracefully with try-catch and silent failures

---

### **5. Window Tracking & System Integration - 2 minutes**

**Cross-Platform Challenge:**
Different OS = different APIs for window tracking.

**What We Implemented:**

**a) Multi-Platform Window Detection**
- **macOS**: Uses `Quartz` API for window info
- **Windows**: Uses `win32gui` and `pygetwindow`
- **Linux**: Uses `Xlib` and `wmctrl`

  - IDEs: VS Code, PyCharm, IntelliJ, Cursor
  - Documents: Word, Google Docs, Excel
  - Study tools: Notion, Anki, Canvas, Moodle
  - Development: Terminal, Git tools
- Detects when users switch to these apps

**c) Browser Tab Analysis**
- Parses browser window titles to extract URL/tab info
- Detects productive websites: GitHub, Stack Overflow, Google Docs, educational sites
- Tab overload detection: 10+ tabs = likely researching/working

**d) Focus Duration Tracking**
- Measures how long user stays on one app
- Continuous focus on productive app = strong productivity signal
- Resets when switching apps

**Learning Journey:**
- Learned different OS APIs and their quirks
- Built abstraction layer for cross-platform compatibility
- Discovered browser title parsing for website detection
- Implemented persistence tracking across app switches

### **6. Behavioral Analysis (Keyboard Tracking) - 1 minute**

**Why Keyboard Tracking?**
Typing patterns reveal productivity better than any visual analysis.

**What We Implemented:**

**a) Real-Time Keystroke Monitoring**
- Uses `pynput` library for cross-platform keyboard hooks
- Tracks typing speed (keys per second)
- Measures sustained typing duration
- Word estimation from keystroke patterns

**b) Productivity Pattern Detection**
- Sustained typing (60+ seconds) = likely writing/coding
- High typing rate (3+ keys/sec) = active work
- Typing bursts separated by pauses = typical productive pattern

**Learning Journey:**
- Learned low-level keyboard event handling
- Implemented privacy-safe tracking (counts only, no key content logged)
- Calculated meaningful metrics from raw keystroke data

- **Window Tracking**: 40% weight  
- **Keyboard Activity**: 20% weight
- Each module scores 0.0-1.0, combined with weighted average

**b) Accumulative Baseline System**
- Tracks highest threshold ever reached (per 0.1 increments)
- Creates "escalating punishment" - once you hit 0.3, you can never drop below it
- Resets only when overlay triggers
- Prevents "gaming the system" by briefly stopping work

**c) Dynamic Thresholding**
- Trigger threshold: 0.4 (40% productivity)
- Progressive warnings at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 (every 10%)
- Visual + system notifications

**d) Real-Time Processing Pipeline**
- Checks every 0.5 seconds
- Parallel processing: OCR runs while window tracking executes
- Queue-based communication with GUI for responsive UI

**Learning Journey:**
- Studied multi-modal fusion techniques
- Balanced different signal types (some noisier than others)
- Implemented feedback system (baseline) for temporal consistency
- Optimized for real-time performance without lag

## 🎯 Q&A PREPARATION

**Expected Questions:**

**Q: Why use multiple detection methods?**
A: No single method is reliable. OCR fails on graphics, window tracking misses browser content, CV can't read text. Multi-modal fusion combines strengths and compensates for weaknesses.

**Q: Why LAB color space?**
A: LAB separates luminance (L) from color (a, b), matching human perception better than RGB. Critical for detecting "white document" appearance.

**Q: How does the baseline system work?**
A: It tracks the highest 0.1 threshold ever reached. Once you hit 0.3, your score can't drop below 0.3 until overlay triggers. Prevents gaming the system by briefly stopping work.

**Q: Why use AI as fallback?**
A: AI is expensive (API costs, latency). Heuristics handle 90% of cases instantly. AI fills gaps when heuristics are uncertain, with caching to minimize costs.

**Q: How do you handle different screen resolutions?**
A: All image processing works on any resolution. Overlay scales dynamically. Tested from 1920x1080 to 2880x1800.

**Q: What was the hardest technical challenge?**
A: Cross-platform window tracking. Each OS has different APIs (Win32, Quartz, Xlib) with different capabilities. Building a unified interface required deep understanding of each platform.
